# StopWatch
 a stopwatch timer with start, pause, resume, reset, and stop buttons.


This is a group coding session aimed at enhancing teamwork and building up on the work done in programming in C# so far. For this group coding session,we will be working on a stopwatch application.
Tasks/Functionalities:
Develop a stopwatch timer with start, pause, resume, reset, and stop buttons.
The time format should be 00:00:00 for (hours:mins:secs)
The start button should start the watch from the secs and adds up to minutes and hours
The pause button should pause the stopwatch and prints its current value to the console or display the current value
The resume button should continue the stopwatch from when it was paused
The reset button should set the watch back to 00:00:00
The stop button should stop the watch and display the last read value
Push your solution to GitHub
Deliverable:
GitHub repository of the project with the final push
A screen record of the gameplay.
A screenshot of the timer showing values other than 00:00:00 for hours, mins and secs respectively.
